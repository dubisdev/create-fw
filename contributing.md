## How to contribute to Create-FW ðŸª“

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dubisdev/create-fw/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dubisdev/create-fw/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Developer: this is for you!

Have you decided to participate in the project? Thank you!

To start developing follow the instructions below:

1. Check that there is no open pull-request for your same feature
1. Check that your feature has not been previously rejected
1. Start your development **from the dev branch** of this repository
1. Clone the repository and install all dependencies: run `yarn` or `npm i`.
1. This project uses **semantic-release** so you must use conventional-commits to make everything work fine. Move the files to the stage area (git add ...) and run `npm commit` or `yarn commit`. There, a console will help you to create commits.
1. If your feature is going to involve a great effort or many changes, open a pull-request as soon as possible so that a maintainer can guide you or, in some case, reject your proposal
1. **All pull-requests must be made to the dev branch**
