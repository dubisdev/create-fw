<h2 align="center"> âš™ OPTIONS </h2>

### ğŸ§° Package manager

By default the CLI uses the package manager used for invoking the command:

        ğŸ‘‰ `yarn create fw` - Uses yarn

        ğŸ‘‰ `npm init fw` / `npx create-fw` - Uses npm

#### ğŸ’¡ You can use some flags to change this

- [x] **`--yarn`**: forces the CLI to use yarn as package manager

  ```bash
  npm init framework-generator --yarn # will use yarn
  ```

- [x] **`--npm`**: forces the CLI to use npm as package manager

  ```bash
  yarn create fw --npm # will use npm
  ```

### ğŸ’¨ Fast mode (default options)

The **`-y` flag** sets all commands as default. It works like the -y flag in `npm init` or `yarn init`: creates the project without asking about personalization to the user.

### ğŸ§° ESModules

Create-FW **does not generate projects based on commonjs** since it is a non-standard technology at the time of creation of the tool. **Therefore all the generated code is based on ESModules**.
