<h2 align="center"> âš™ OPTIONS </h2>

### ðŸ§° Package manager

By default the CLI uses the package manager used for invoking the command:

        ðŸ‘‰ `yarn create fw` - Uses yarn

        ðŸ‘‰ `npm init fw` / `npx create-fw` - Uses npm

#### ðŸ’¡ You can use some flags to change this

- [x] **`--yarn`**: forces the CLI to use yarn as package manager

  ```bash
  npm init framework-generator --yarn # will use yarn
  ```

- [x] **`--npm`**: forces the CLI to use npm as package manager

  ```bash
  yarn create fw --npm # will use npm
  ```

  <p align="center">-----</p>

### ðŸ’¨ Fast mode (default options)

The **`-y` flag** sets all commands as default. It works like the -y flag in `npm init` or `yarn init`: creates the project without asking about personalization to the user.

### ðŸ§° CommmonJS or ESModules

We believe that the future of JS development must go through the abandonment of CommonJS, so the **default system creates projects to develop using ESModules**.

Despite this, there is an option to configure the project to work with CommonJS, and this is using the "-cjs" flag

        ðŸ‘‰ `yarn create fw --cjs` - Creates a project to work with CommonJS

        ðŸ‘‰ `npm init fw --cjs` / `npx create-fw --cjs` - Creates a project to work with CommonJS
